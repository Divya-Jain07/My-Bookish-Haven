                <h1>The Hungry Tide by Amitav Ghosh</h1>
                <p>The Hungry Tide is a gripping novel set in the Sundarbans, a mystical and dangerous region of India where rivers meet the sea, and man coexists with nature's raw power. 
                    Amitav Ghosh masterfully weaves together themes of survival, identity, and ecological harmony. The story revolves around three central characters: 
                    Piyali Roy, a marine biologist exploring the region's unique ecosystem; Kanai Dutt, a sophisticated translator drawn into the wilderness by a family letter
                    and Fokir, an uneducated yet intuitive fisherman who becomes Piya's guide. Their lives intersect amidst the tides, revealing deep connections between humans
                    and nature, and the tensions between development and conservation.</p>
                 <p>Ghosh's vivid descriptions bring the Sundarbans alive—the mangroves, the treacherous waters, and the majestic yet fearsome Bengal tiger. 
                    At its heart, the novel questions humanity's place in the natural order and highlights the fragile balance we often disrupt.
                    This is a beautifully written, thought-provoking novel that immerses readers in a world of mystery and struggle. If you’re drawn to stories that blend culture,
                    environment, and humanity, The Hungry Tide is a must-read.</p>

                    <h1>Here, there and everywhere by Sudha Murthy</h1>
                    <p>
                        This book was a random read tbh as fiction is my go-to-genre. It speaks the simplicity of the author herself. 
                        The book itself is touching and straightforward - each story feels like a life lesson wrapped in warmth, 
                        teaching me morals as I step forward into the corporate world.
                        The last two stories especially inspired me to think beyond myself and try helping the less fortunate in small ways.</p>

                    <h1>Days at the Morisaki Bookshop by Satoshi Yagisawa</h1>
                    <p>
                        I have completed the book The days at the morisaki bookshop just now and there are so many thoughts
                        swirling within me... I thought it to be a casual read (a good start for the year), but this wicked 
                        book made me sobbed, laugh and made me sad at couple times...</p>
                        <p>
                           Just when I thought the story is becoming clear and everything is resolving for good between the 
                           characters and their personal turmoil, it seems to have just started. The things aren't that easy
                          rather they are quite emotional! Now if I say anything further I might spoil it for those who haven't read this.
                          So please give this book a chance because it truly deserves to get the attention...

                    <h1>And the mountains echoed by Khaled Hosseini</h1>
                    <p>
                        And the Mountains Echoed by Khaled Hosseini is about the way our lives intertwine and the choices we make,
                         which often blur the line between right and wrong. None of the characters live perfect lives—they face tough 
                         situations that make them question their decisions, and just like us, sometimes what seems right to one person
                          can break another's world.</p>
                        <p>
                            The book isn't just about a brother and sister; it's much more than that. It's about how time works—how memories 
                            shape us, and how a “home” is more than just a place; it's where our stories unfold over time, seen through the lives around us.

                    <h1>More Days at the Morisaki Bookshop by Satoshi Yagisawa</h1>
                    <p>
                        More Days in the Morisaki Bookshop is a beautifully written story that tugs at your heartstrings.
                         Its emotional depth and rawness left me sobbing through the final chapters. The book explores themes 
                         of self-discovery, healing, and the transformative power of books and human connection. 
                         The protagonist's journey is both relatable and heartwarming, as you follow her through moments of 
                         heartbreak and renewal. The intimate setting of the bookshop adds charm and nostalgia, making it feel 
                         like a haven for broken souls. If you enjoy poignant stories that leave a lasting impact, this one is an 
                         absolute must-read. </p>
